# Toolchain

## Babel

Babel is a JavaScript compiler. It is mainly used to convert ES6 and later code into backwards compatible version. This allows developers to use latest syntax without waiting for browser support.

In case of React, Babel can convert JSX syntax

## Webpack

Webpack is a static module bundler for JS application. It puts all the assets including JavaScript, images, fonts and CSS in a dependency graph and generates one or more bundles.

With node.js, require() can be used to modularize JS files. The browser doesn't support require() so a build tool is used to transform above files into a bundled file that browser can execute properly.
